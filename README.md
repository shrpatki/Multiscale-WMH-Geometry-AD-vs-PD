# Multiscale-WMH-Geometry-AD-vs-PD
We present a multiscale geometric and topological framework for quantitative characterization of WMH morphology using structural MRI data from the ADNI and the PPMI.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are recognized imaging markers of small vessel injury frequently observed in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite their shared presence, the underlying lesion formation mechanisms differ across these disorders. In this study, we present a multiscale geometric and topological framework for quantitative characterization of WMH morphology using structural MRI data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The proposed pipeline extracts 22 volumetric, shape, and topological features, along with five derived mechanistic indices that capture disease-specific morphogenetic regimes: Fusion Index, Micro-Foci Index, Lesion Consolidation Ratio, Geometric Complexity, and Fusion Pattern Score. Statistical analyses revealed significant group-level differences in lesion count, size, and shape between AD and PD, indicating that AD is characterized by fewer, larger, and more complex lesions consistent with a fusion-dominant process, whereas PD exhibits numerous smaller and spatially dispersed micro-foci. Machine learning models trained on these geometric signatures achieved robust classification performance, confirming the discriminative value of the derived mechanistic indices. These findings demonstrate that WMH lesion geometry encodes meaningful mechanistic information and may serve as a quantitative biomarker for distinguishing neurodegenerative disease processes.

As the ADNI and PPMI databases are always evolving, it is possible that the code may not work if the database has changed since the date the code was created.
